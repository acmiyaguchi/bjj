# Guard Passes

Guard passing is the art of getting past an opponent's legs to achieve a dominant position. It's one of the fundamental skills in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and essential for effective top game.

## Philosophy of Guard Passing

### Core Principles

- **Control First**: Establish grips and control before attempting to pass
- **Pressure or Speed**: Choose your approach based on situation
- **Multiple Options**: Always have backup plans when passes are defended
- **Patience**: Don't rush, especially with pressure passes

### Types of Passes

#### Pressure Passes

- Use weight and control to pin opponent
- Methodical and systematic
- Good for when you have size/strength advantage
- Examples: Knee slice, smash pass, stack pass

#### Speed Passes

- Use quick movement and timing
- Dynamic and athletic
- Good against flexible opponents
- Examples: Torreando, X-pass, leg drag

#### Distance Passes

- Pass from standing or at distance
- Avoid guard player's attacks
- Control legs from far away
- Examples: Standing passes, long step

## Key Concepts

### Posture and Base

- Maintain good posture to avoid submissions
- Wide base to prevent sweeps
- Stay balanced throughout pass

### Grip Fighting

- Control opponent's sleeves and collar
- Prevent them from controlling your movement
- Break their grips when necessary

### Direction and Angles

- Pass to the side, not straight forward
- Create angles to make defense harder
- Use opponent's movement against them

## Common Guard Pass Categories

## Dealing with Guard Retention

- Underhooks to prevent settling
- Leg frames to create distance
- Re-guard attempts

### Countering Defenses

- Control opponent's hips
- Stay patient and methodical
- Chain different passes together

## Pass Combinations

- Switch to speed when they frame
- Use their defensive reactions

### Side to Side

- Attack one side first
- When defended, switch sides
- Keep opponent moving

### High to Low

- Drop to low passes when defended
- Use vertical space
