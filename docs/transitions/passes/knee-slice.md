# Knee Slice Pass

The knee slice pass (also known as knee cut pass) is one of the most fundamental and high-percentage guard passes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It's characterized by driving one knee across the opponent's legs while maintaining pressure and control.

## Mechanism

The knee slice pass works by:

1. Creating pressure and control on the opponent's legs
2. Using one knee to "slice" across their guard
3. Establishing control of their upper body
4. Transitioning to a dominant position (usually side control)

## Basic Execution

### Step-by-Step

1. **Establish Grips**: Control their collar and sleeve/pants
2. **Knee Placement**: Drive your knee across their thigh/hip
3. **Pressure Down**: Apply downward pressure with your shin
4. **Control Upper Body**: Maintain head/shoulder control
5. **Slide the Knee**: Push their legs away while sliding knee across
6. **Establish Side Control**: Secure the pass with proper positioning

### Key Details

- **Pressure First**: Establish heavy pressure before attempting to slide
- **Knee Direction**: Knee should cut across, not straight down
- **Head Position**: Keep your head on the opposite side of where you're passing
- **Hip Pressure**: Use your hips to drive through the pass

## Grips and Control

### Gi Grips

- **Cross Collar**: Control their far collar
- **Pants Grip**: Control their near-side pants at the knee
- **Sleeve Control**: Can control their far sleeve instead
- **Underhook**: Sometimes used on the near side

### No-Gi Grips

- **Underhook**: Deep underhook on far side
- **Crossface**: Control their head/neck
- **Overhook**: Control their near arm
- **Knee Shield**: Hand on their knee to create distance

## Common Setups

### From Headquarters Position

- Establish the knee slice from the classic headquarters position
- One leg forward, one leg back
- Control established before passing

### From Stack Position

- Drive opponent's knees to their chest first
- Use the stack to set up the knee slice angle
- Transition from stack to slice

### From Failed Guard Pass

- When other passes are defended
- Knee slice as a backup option
- Flow between different passing attempts

## Dealing with Resistance

### Common Defenses

- **Knee Shield**: Opponent frames with their knee
- **Underhook**: They get an underhook on your leg
- **Hip Escape**: They try to shrimp away
- **Re-guard**: Attempting to recover guard

### Overcoming Defenses

#### Against Knee Shield

- **Pressure and Wait**: Sometimes patience is key
- **Switch Sides**: Go to the other side
- **Backstep**: Step around their guard
- **Underhook**: Get underneath their knee shield

#### Against Underhook

- **Crossface**: Counter with strong crossface
- **Whizzer**: Overhook their underhook
- **Spin**: Change direction of your pass
- **Back**: Take their back if they turn

## Common Mistakes

### Technical Errors

- **No Pressure**: Trying to slide without establishing control first
- **Wrong Angle**: Knee going straight down instead of across
- **Poor Timing**: Rushing before establishing control
- **Lost Head Position**: Not maintaining proper head position

### Tactical Mistakes

- **Single Attempts**: Not flowing to other passes when defended
- **Predictable**: Always going to the same side
- **Loose Control**: Not maintaining grips during the pass

## Combinations and Transitions

### Other Guard Passes

- **Torreando Pass**: If knee slice is defended
- **Double Under**: Alternative pressure pass
- **Long Step**: If they create distance
- **Stack Pass**: Using similar pressure concepts

### Back Takes

- **Over-Under**: If they turn away from the pass
- **Single Leg**: If they give up their back defending

### Submissions

- **Knee Slice Kimura**: Attacking the arm during the pass
- **Crossface Kimura**: Using the crossface position
- **Darce Choke**: If they defend poorly with their arm placement

## Drilling and Development

### Solo Drills

- Hip movement and pressure
- Knee placement practice
- Core strengthening for pressure

### Partner Drills

- Slow motion passing
- Progressive resistance
- Guard retention vs. passing
- Flow between different passes

### Positional Sparring

- Start from guard with passing intent
- Limited time rounds
- Specific scenarios (with/without certain grips)
