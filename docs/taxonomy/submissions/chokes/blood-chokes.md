# Blood Chokes

Blood chokes are submission techniques that work by compressing the carotid arteries, restricting blood flow to the brain. They are the most common and effective type of choke in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Mechanism

Blood chokes work by:
- Compressing carotid arteries on sides of neck
- Reducing blood flow to the brain
- Causing unconsciousness within seconds
- Generally considered safer than air chokes

## Anatomical Targets

### Carotid Arteries
- Located on both sides of neck
- Primary target for blood chokes
- Easy to compress with proper technique
- Quick and effective

### Proper Pressure Points
- Sides of neck, not front
- Avoid crushing trachea
- Focus on artery compression
- Use leverage, not pure strength
