# Americana

The Americana is a fundamental shoulder lock that attacks the shoulder joint through rotation. It's the opposite direction of rotation from the Kimura and is often taught as a beginner-friendly submission.

## Mechanism

The Americana works by:
- Isolating the opponent's arm
- Creating a figure-4 grip with your arms
- Using leverage to rotate the shoulder in the opposite direction from Kimura
- Applying pressure to the shoulder joint

## Basic Setup

### Grip Formation
- Pin opponent's wrist to the ground
- Thread your arm under their arm
- Grab your own wrist to complete figure-4
- Create leverage against their shoulder

### Key Details
- Keep their wrist pinned down
- Lift their elbow while maintaining wrist control
- Use your body weight for leverage
- Apply pressure gradually

## Common Positions

### From Mount
- Classic position for Americana
- Good control and leverage
- Opponent's arm naturally positioned
- High success rate

### From Side Control
- Alternative setup position
- Good when mount isn't available
- Requires proper positioning
- Control opponent's movement

### From Knee on Belly
- Transitional setup
- Use knee pressure for control
- Quick submission opportunity
- Good against defensive opponents

## Key Differences from Kimura

### Direction of Rotation
- Americana rotates shoulder toward their head
- Kimura rotates shoulder toward their back
- Opposite mechanical stress on joint

### Grip Positioning
- Americana pins wrist down
- Different leverage points
- Modified body positioning required

## Common Defenses

### Opponent's Escapes
- Pulling elbow to their body
- Rolling to relieve pressure
- Grabbing their own gi/body
- Creating space and turning

### Maintaining Control
- Keep wrist firmly pinned
- Use body weight effectively
- Transition if they escape grip
- Don't force if strongly defended

## Combinations

### With Other Submissions
- Americana to cross collar choke
- Mount armbar if they defend
- Triangle transitions possible
- Flow with kimura attempts

### Position Transitions
- Use setup to advance position
- Back take if they turn away
- Maintain mount throughout attempt
