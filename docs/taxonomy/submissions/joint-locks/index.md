# Joint Locks

Joint locks are submission techniques that work by hyperextending or rotating joints beyond their natural range of motion. They are fundamental submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Mechanism

Joint locks work by:

- Isolating a specific joint
- Creating a fulcrum point
- Applying leverage to exceed the joint's natural range
- Forcing the opponent to submit to prevent injury

## Categories by Body Region

## Safety Considerations

- Create proper angles for maximum efficiency
- Understand the biomechanics involved

### Control
