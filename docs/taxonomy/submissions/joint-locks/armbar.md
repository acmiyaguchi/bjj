# Armbar (Juji Gatame)

The armbar, known as Juji Gatame in judo, is one of the most fundamental and high-percentage submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It attacks the elbow joint through hyperextension and can be applied from numerous positions.

## Mechanism

The armbar works by:

1. Isolating one of the opponent's arms
2. Creating a fulcrum point at their elbow
3. Applying pressure to hyperextend the elbow joint
4. Using your hips and legs to generate leverage

## Basic Setup from Closed Guard

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Break Posture**: Control opponent's posture, break them down
2. **Arm Isolation**: Push one arm across their body
3. **Hip Movement**: Angle your hips away from the trapped arm
4. **Leg Placement**: Throw your leg over their head/shoulder
5. **Control the Wrist**: Secure their wrist with both hands
6. **Hip Thrust**: Drive your hips up to apply pressure

### Key Details

- **Pinch Your Knees**: Keep knees tight together
- **Control the Thumb**: Their thumb should point up
- **Hip Placement**: Your hips should be close to their elbow
- **Gradual Pressure**: Apply pressure slowly and steadily

## Variations and Setups

### From Mount

- **High Mount Armbar**: When opponent pushes your hips
- **S-Mount Transition**: Step over to s-mount position
- **Cross-Body Armbar**: When opponent turns away

### From Side Control

- **Near-Side Armbar**: Attacking the arm closest to you
- **Far-Side Armbar**: More complex setup for far arm
- **Knee-on-Belly Armbar**: Using knee-on-belly as transition

### From Back Control

- **Standard Back Armbar**: Trapping one arm while maintaining back control
- **Rolling Armbar**: Dynamic rolling motion to secure the submission

## Common Defenses

### Opponent's Escapes

- **Clasping Hands**: Grabbing their own wrist or gi
- **Rolling Over**: Rolling over the top to escape
- **Stacking**: Driving their weight into you
- **Posturing Up**: Trying to stand and pull out

### Maintaining Control

- **Hand Fighting**: Breaking their defensive grips
- **Hip Pressure**: Keeping hips close to prevent escape
- **Leg Control**: Using legs to prevent their movement
- **Patience**: Don't rush the finish

## Common Mistakes

### Technical Errors

- **Wrong Hip Position**: Too far from their elbow
- **Loose Knees**: Not keeping knees pinched together
- **Poor Wrist Control**: Letting them escape their arm
- **Rushing**: Applying pressure too quickly

### Positional Mistakes

- **Bad Angle**: Not creating proper angle before attacking
- **Lost Control**: Letting opponent regain posture
- **Weak Setup**: Not properly isolating the arm first

## Combination Attacks

### High-Percentage Combinations

- **Armbar to Triangle**: If they defend armbar, switch to triangle
- **Triangle to Armbar**: Classic back-and-forth combination
- **Armbar to Omoplata**: Alternative shoulder attack
- **Sweep to Armbar**: Using sweep motion to set up armbar

### Flow Drilling

Practice moving smoothly between:

- Armbar ↔ Triangle
- Armbar ↔ Omoplata
- Guard ↔ Armbar ↔ Back to Guard

## Drilling and Development

### Solo Drills

- Hip movement and angling
- Leg coordination exercises
- Flexibility for hip mobility

### Partner Drills

- Slow-motion armbar practice
- Defense and re-attack
- Flow between combinations
- Positional sparring from setup positions

### Resistance Training

- Partner provides light resistance
- Escape and re-attack scenarios
- Time pressure drills

## Competition Application

### Rule Considerations

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels
- **Submission Only**: High finishing rate
- **Time Pressure**: Quick setup and execution

### Strategic Use

- **Early Round**: Set up the position
- **Late Round**: Force the pace with attacks
- **Combination**: Use with other attacks for maximum effect
