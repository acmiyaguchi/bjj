# Kimura

The Kimura is a fundamental shoulder lock that attacks the shoulder joint through rotation and hyperextension. Named after Masahiko Kimura, it's one of the most versatile submissions in BJJ.

## Mechanism

The Kimura works by:
- Isolating the opponent's arm
- Creating a figure-4 grip with your arms
- Using leverage to rotate the shoulder
- Applying pressure to the shoulder joint

## Basic Setup

### Grip Formation
- Grab opponent's wrist with same-side hand
- Reach under and grab your own wrist
- Create figure-4 configuration
- Control their arm completely

### Key Details
