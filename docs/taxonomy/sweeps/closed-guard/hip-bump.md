# Hip Bump Sweep

The hip bump sweep is a fundamental sweep from closed guard that uses hip movement and timing to off-balance and reverse the opponent. It's often one of the first sweeps taught to beginners due to its simple mechanics and high success rate.

## Mechanism

The hip bump sweep works by:

1. Using your hips to bump the opponent forward and off-balance them
2. Trapping their arm to prevent them from posting
3. Following through with the sweep to achieve top position

## Setup and Execution

### Step-by-Step

1. **Closed Guard Position**: Start in closed guard with good posture control
2. **Sit Up**: Use your abs to sit up towards your opponent
3. **Arm Control**: Wrap one arm around their back, trap their arm
4. **Hip Bump**: Use your hip to bump them forward
5. **Off-Balance**: Push them over your trapped arm side
6. **Follow Through**: Come up to mount or side control

### Key Details

- **Timing**: Execute when opponent is leaning forward slightly
- **Arm Trap**: Must control their arm to prevent posting
- **Hip Power**: Use your hip, not just your hands
- **Direction**: Sweep over the trapped arm side

## Grips and Control

### Gi Grips

- **Over/Under**: One arm over their back, one under their arm
- **Collar Control**: Can grab the back of their collar
- **Sleeve Control**: Control the arm you're not trapping

### No-Gi Grips

- **Underhook**: Deep underhook on one side
- **Overhook**: Control the opposite arm
- **Head Control**: Can control the back of their head

## Common Setups

### From Posture Breaking

- Break their posture first
- As they try to regain posture, sit up for the bump

### From Failed Submissions

- Attempted armbar that fails
- Failed triangle attempt
- Use their defensive movement

### Combination Attacks

- **High-Low**: Threaten high (submissions) then go low (sweep)
- **Side to Side**: Threaten one side, then sweep to other

## Common Defenses

### Opponent's Counters

- **Posting**: Using free arm to post on the ground
- **Base Widening**: Spreading their base to prevent the sweep
- **Counter Pressure**: Driving into you to prevent sitting up

### Overcoming Defenses

- **Better Timing**: Wait for right moment when they're off-balance
- **Arm Isolation**: Better control of their posting arm
- **Combination**: Chain with other attacks if sweep fails

## Common Mistakes

- **No Arm Control**: Not properly trapping their arm
- **Wrong Timing**: Attempting when opponent has good base
- **Weak Hip Movement**: Not using hip power effectively
- **Poor Follow Through**: Not completing the sweep to dominant position

## Transitions and Combinations

### If Sweep Succeeds

- **Mount**: Classic finish position
- **Side Control**: Alternative top position
- **Knee on Belly**: Transitional control position

### If Sweep Fails

- **Back to Guard**: Maintain guard and try again
- **Submission Attempts**: Triangle, armbar, kimura
- **Other Sweeps**: Scissor sweep, flower sweep

## Drilling and Development

### Solo Drills

- Hip thrust movements
- Sit-up exercises
- Core strengthening

### Partner Drills

- Slow motion execution
- Resistance drilling
- Combination flow with submissions
