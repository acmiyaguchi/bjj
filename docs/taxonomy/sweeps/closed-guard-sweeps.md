# Sweeps from Closed Guard

Closed guard sweeps are fundamental techniques that allow the bottom player to reverse position and gain top control. These sweeps form the foundation of guard play in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Key Concepts

### Prerequisites for Successful Sweeps

- **Posture Control**: Break opponent's posture first
- **Off-Balancing**: Create instability in opponent's base
- **Timing**: Execute when opponent is moving or off-balance
- **Direction**: Sweep over the path of least resistance

### Common Setup Principles

- Use grips to control opponent's movement
- Create angles with hip movement
- Combine with submission threats
- Follow through to dominant position
