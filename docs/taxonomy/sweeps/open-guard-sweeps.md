# Sweeps from Open Guard

Open guard sweeps utilize various open guard positions to off-balance and reverse the opponent. These sweeps often require more timing and technique than closed guard sweeps.

## Key Concepts

### Open Guard Principles

- **Distance Management**: Controlling space between you and opponent
- **Grip Fighting**: Establishing and maintaining advantageous grips
- **Leg Positioning**: Using legs as frames and hooks
- **Angle Creation**: Getting off the center line for better leverage

### Timing Considerations

- Sweep when opponent steps or shifts weight
- Use their forward pressure against them
- Attack during their passing attempts
- Combine with guard retention

## Basic Open Guard Sweeps

### Tripod Sweep

- Uses collar and sleeve grips
- One leg on hip, other foot on ground as tripod
- Sweeps when opponent steps forward

### Sickle Sweep

- Uses foot behind opponent's ankle
- Pulls with arms while sweeping ankle
- Great for when opponent has one foot forward

### Hook Sweep

- Uses foot as hook behind opponent's leg
- Combined with collar/sleeve control
- Timing-based sweep

## Specialized Guard Sweeps

- Combination attacks
- Using their defensive reactions
- Transitioning between different guards

## Training Methods
