# BJJ Technique Taxonomy

Welcome to the comprehensive Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu technique taxonomy. This system organizes BJJ techniques into four primary categories based on their function and application.

## Overview

The structure is organized into four primary categories:

1. **[Positional Hierarchy](positions/index.md)**: The state or position from which techniques are initiated. This is the highest level of classification.

2. **[Submissions](submissions/index.md)**: Techniques intended to finish the opponent.

3. **[Sweeps & Reversals](sweeps/index.md)**: Techniques used to reverse a disadvantageous position or improve one's own position.

4. **[Transitions & Escapes](transitions/index.md)**: Movements used to escape positions or transition between them.

## How to Use This Taxonomy

Each category contains detailed breakdowns of specific techniques, positions, and concepts. Navigate through the sections to explore the rich technical landscape of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

The taxonomy is designed to help practitioners understand the relationship between different techniques and how they fit into the broader context of BJJ strategy and application.
