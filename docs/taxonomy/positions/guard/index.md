# Guard Overview

The guard is a fundamental position in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu where the bottom player uses their legs to control, attack, and defend against their opponent. It transforms what would traditionally be considered a disadvantageous bottom position into an active, offensive position.

## Philosophy of Guard

The guard position embodies one of BJJ's core principles: using technique and leverage to overcome size and strength disadvantages. From the guard, a smaller practitioner can:

- Control a larger opponent
- Launch effective attacks
- Prevent the opponent from striking (in MMA contexts)
- Set up sweeps to reverse position

## Types of Guard

### [Closed Guard](closed.md)

The foundational guard where legs are locked around the opponent's waist.

### [Open Guard](open.md)

Various guard positions where the legs are not locked, allowing for more dynamic movement and attacks.

### [Half Guard](half.md)

Position where one of the opponent's legs is trapped between your legs.

## Key Concepts Across All Guards

### Control

- **Distance Management**: Controlling how close or far the opponent can be
- **Posture Control**: Breaking and maintaining broken posture
- **Grip Fighting**: Establishing and maintaining advantageous grips

### Attacks

- **Submissions**: Direct finishing techniques
- **Sweeps**: Reversing position to gain top control
- **Back Takes**: Transitioning to the dominant back position

### Mobility

- **Hip Movement**: Essential for creating angles and opportunities
- **Guard Retention**: Maintaining guard when opponent tries to pass
- **Transitions**: Moving between different guard types

## Guard Strategy

### Active vs. Passive Guard

- **Active Guard**: Constantly threatening with submissions and sweeps
- **Passive Guard**: Focusing primarily on defense and preventing passes

### High-Low Game

- **High Attacks**: Submissions targeting upper body (chokes, armbars)
- **Low Attacks**: Sweeps and leg attacks
- **Combination**: Mixing high and low to create opportunities

## Common Principles

### Breaking Posture

Most guard attacks require breaking the opponent's posture:

- Pull them forward
- Prevent them from sitting back
- Use grips to maintain control

### Creating Angles

- Hip movement to get off the center line
- Angling to set up attacks
- Using angles to make escapes more difficult

### Timing

- Attacking when opponent is off-balance
- Using their movement against them
- Patience to wait for the right moment
