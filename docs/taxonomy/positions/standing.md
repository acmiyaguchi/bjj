# Standing Position & Takedowns

The standing position represents the neutral starting point in BJJ where both competitors are on their feet. From here, the goal is typically to take the opponent to the ground while maintaining or achieving a dominant position.

## Key Concepts

### Grips and Control

- Collar ties
- Underhooks
- Overhooks
- Wrist control

### Stance and Movement

- Athletic stance
- Footwork
- Level changes
- Sprawls

## Categories of Takedowns

### Single Leg Takedowns

Attacks targeting one leg of the opponent.

- Basic single leg
- High crotch
- Low single

### Double Leg Takedowns

Attacks targeting both legs simultaneously.

- Basic double leg
- Blast double
- Duck under to double

### Hip Throws (Judo-based)

Using hip placement and leverage.

- O Goshi (Major Hip Throw)
- Uchi Mata (Inner Thigh Throw)
- Harai Goshi (Sweeping Hip Throw)

### Foot Sweeps

Using timing and foot placement.

- De Ashi Barai (Advancing Foot Sweep)
- Ko Uchi Gari (Minor Inner Reaping)
- O Uchi Gari (Major Inner Reaping)

### Sacrifice Throws

Throws where you give up your standing position.

- Tomoe Nage (Circle Throw)
- Sumi Gaeshi (Corner Reversal)

## Takedown Defense

### Sprawl

Primary defense against leg attacks.

### Underhooks

Preventing opponent's grip fighting.

### Distance Management

Staying out of range or too close to be taken down.

## Transition to Ground Game

The goal of takedowns is not just to get the opponent down, but to land in a dominant position:

- Side control
- Mount
- Guard (if pulled)
- Turtle position (to avoid or take back)
