# Closed Guard

The closed guard is one of the fundamental positions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It's characterized by the bottom player wrapping their legs around the opponent's waist and locking their feet together, creating a "closed" guard.

## Position Overview

In closed guard, the person on bottom (guard player) has their back on the ground with their legs wrapped around their opponent's torso. The legs are locked at the ankles, creating a strong controlling position.

## Key Concepts

### Control

- **Posture Breaking**: Preventing the opponent from sitting up straight
- **Grip Fighting**: Controlling the opponent's hands and arms
- **Hip Movement**: Using hip mobility to create angles and opportunities

### Breaking Posture

- Pull down on the back of the head/neck
- Use grips on the gi (collar, sleeves)
- Break posture to set up attacks

## Guard Opening Defense

When the opponent tries to open your closed guard:

- Maintain grips
- Follow their movement
- Use their opening attempts to set up attacks
- Transition to open guard if necessary

## Common Mistakes

- **Staying Flat**: Not using hip movement to create angles
- **Weak Grips**: Not maintaining control of the opponent
- **No Posture Breaking**: Allowing opponent to posture up
- **Predictable Attacks**: Telegraphing submissions

## Drills and Development

- Sit-ups from guard
