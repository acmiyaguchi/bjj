# BJJ Notes

This site is a collection of personal notes on BJJ techniques, concepts, and ideas.
It is mostly intended for personal use, but I hope it can be useful to others as well.

!!! info
    This site is a work in progress.
    Much of the content as of now is generated through the use of AI tools for research.
    I'd like to avoid this being complete slop, so avoid using this as a primary source of information.
