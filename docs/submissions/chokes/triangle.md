# Triangle Choke

The triangle choke is one of the most fundamental and effective submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It's a blood choke that uses the legs to compress the carotid arteries, typically executed from guard positions.

## Mechanism

The triangle choke works by:

1. Creating a triangle shape with your legs around the opponent's neck and one arm
2. Trapping one arm inside the triangle while keeping the other outside
3. Applying pressure to compress the carotid arteries
4. Cutting off blood flow to the brain

## Setup from Closed Guard

### Basic Setup

1. **Break Posture**: Pull opponent down, break their upright posture
2. **Arm Isolation**: Push one arm across their body while pulling the other
3. **Hip Movement**: Angle your hips to create space
4. **Leg Placement**: Throw your leg over their shoulder/neck
5. **Lock the Triangle**: Pull your shin to your other leg's ankle
6. **Adjust and Finish**: Angle your hips and squeeze

### Key Details

- **One Arm In, One Out**: Critical that only one arm is trapped
- **Angle Your Hips**: Don't stay directly underneath
- **Pull Their Head Down**: Increase the pressure
- **Squeeze Your Knees**: Together to tighten the choke

## Common Variations

### From Different Guards

- **Open Guard Triangle**: Set up from spider guard or other open guards
- **High Guard Triangle**: From when opponent postures up
- **Side Triangle**: When opponent defends, transition to side

### Adjustments

- **Leg Adjustments**: If triangle feels loose, adjust leg position
- **Hip Adjustments**: Angle more to tighten
- **Arm Drag Setup**: Use arm drag to create the opening

## Common Defenses and Counters

### Opponent's Defenses

- **Posture Up**: Opponent tries to stand and break the lock
- **Stack**: Opponent drives forward to stack you
- **Arm Positioning**: Opponent tries to get both arms to same side

### Your Counters

- **Adjust Angle**: Change hip angle to maintain control
- **Transition to Armbar**: If triangle is defended, switch to armbar
- **Omoplata**: Another transition option if triangle fails

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong Leg Position**: Using the wrong leg to apply pressure
- **No Hip Angle**: Staying flat underneath opponent
- **Rushing the Finish**: Not properly setting up the position first
- **Letting Opponent Posture**: Not maintaining posture control
