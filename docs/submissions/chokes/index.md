# Chokes (Strangulations)

Chokes are submission techniques that work by restricting either blood flow to the brain or airflow to the lungs. They are among the most effective finishing techniques in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Target the trachea to restrict airflow:

- Generally used as components of other chokes
- Less preferred in sport BJJ
- Can be more dangerous if applied incorrectly
