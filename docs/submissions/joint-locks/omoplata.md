# Omoplata

The omoplata is a shoulder lock submission that uses the legs to isolate and attack the opponent's shoulder. It's both a submission and a powerful control position.

## Mechanism

The omoplata works by:
- Using your legs to isolate opponent's arm
- Creating leverage on their shoulder
- Rotating and hyperextending the shoulder joint
- Can be finished as submission or used for control

## Basic Setup from Guard

### Initial Setup
- Opponent has arm extended (often from armbar defense)
- Thread your leg over their arm
- Control their arm with your legs
- Prevent them from rolling

### Positioning
- Their arm should be behind their back
- Your leg acts as a brace across their back
- Control their head/neck area
- Create angle for finishing

## Key Details

### Leg Positioning
- Shin across opponent's back
- Foot controls their far hip
- Knee pressure on their shoulder
- Maintain connection throughout

### Hip Movement
- Angle your hips away from opponent
- Create leverage for the submission
- Don't stay directly underneath
- Use hip pressure for control

## Finishing Options

### Submission Finish
- Lift their elbow while driving forward
- Create shoulder hyperextension
- Apply pressure gradually
- Force tap or position improvement

### Control Position
- Use omoplata position for control
- Set up other attacks
- Back take opportunities
- Sweep possibilities

## Common Defenses

### Opponent's Escapes
- Rolling forward over their trapped arm
- Stacking you to relieve pressure
- Pulling their arm out
- Creating space

### Maintaining Control
- Control their head to prevent rolling
- Use your free leg to block movement
- Transition to other attacks if necessary
- Don't force if strongly defended

## Transitions
