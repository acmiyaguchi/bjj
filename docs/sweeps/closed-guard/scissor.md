# Scissor Sweep

The scissor sweep is a fundamental closed guard sweep that uses a scissoring action with the legs to off-balance and reverse the opponent.

## Mechanism

The scissor sweep works by:
- Using one leg to lift opponent
- Using other leg to sweep their base
- Creating a scissoring motion
- Following through to top position

## Basic Setup

### Initial Position
- Closed guard with posture broken
- Grip on opponent's collar and sleeve
- Angle your body to one side
- Prepare scissoring action

### Execution
- Top leg (at their chest) lifts up
- Bottom leg (at their ankle) sweeps out
- Pull with grips while scissoring
- Follow through to mount/side control

### Key Details
- Timing is crucial
- Must break posture first
- Use grips to assist sweep
- Scissor motion, not individual leg movements

## Grip Variations

### Gi Grips
- Cross collar and sleeve
- Same side collar and sleeve
- Pants and collar combinations

### No-Gi Grips
- Underhook and overhook
- Head and arm control
- Modified grip patterns

## Common Mistakes

### Technical Errors
- Not breaking posture first
- Wrong timing on scissor action
- Poor grip maintenance
- Incomplete follow through

### Setup Errors
- Not creating proper angle
- Telegraphing the sweep
- Weak initial grips
- Poor body positioning
